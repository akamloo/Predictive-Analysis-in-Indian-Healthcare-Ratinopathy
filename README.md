To predict whether the person has diabetes or not by applying predictive analytic (PDA) techniques on Anthropometric data i.e. (Non Invasive). Precisely analysis is done by Image Processing and Deep Learning is used to construct the model. Using patient’s RETINA image by applying different type of algorithms (SVM, Neural Network, Naïve Bays, Logistic Regression, etc.) and we used spark clusters for parallel data processing.
